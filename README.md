# Deep-Learning-for-Malware-Detection-A-CNN-Based-Approach

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop and evaluate a deep learning model using CNNs for the detection of malware within images. By doing so, we aim to contribute to the broader field of cybersecurity by enhancing the efficiency and adaptability of malware detection, ultimately reinforcing the resilience of digital systems and data privacy in an era where cyber threats are increasingly sophisticated and insidious.
